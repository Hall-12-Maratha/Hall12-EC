    *** SIMULATING ADMIN CLAIM ***
    *
    * In a real application, you would use the Firebase Admin SDK to set a custom 
    * claim for the user with the email: ${email}.
    *
    * Example using Admin SDK:
    *
    * import { auth } from 'firebase-admin';
    * 
    * const user = await auth().getUserByEmail('${email}');
    * await auth().setCustomUserClaims(user.uid, { admin: true });
    *
    * This action needs to be performed in a secure backend environment.
    * For now, to proceed, you need to manually add the custom claim in your 
    * local environment or directly in your Firebase project if you have one.
    *
    * After setting the claim, the user needs to sign out and sign back in 
    * for the changes to take effect.
    *
